### Tools and Resources

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/): Employed for version control, enabling regular commits to Git and updates to GitHub from the terminal in Gitpod.

- [GitHub](https://github.com/): Hosts the repository containing the project's code. GitHub Pages also hosts the live version of the website.

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/): The code editor of choice for developing the website, offering powerful coding and debugging tools.

- [OpenAI's ChatGPT](https://openai.com/): Assisted in validating code, checking spelling, providing translations, offering coding advice, and supporting the refinement of the website's content and functionality. ChatGPT also played a role in generating content for documentation and assisting with real-time troubleshooting during development.

### Introduction

### Why Visual Studio Code and WSL?

Visual Studio Code is a powerful and versatile code editor that supports a wide range of programming languages and frameworks. Its extensive library of extensions makes it highly customizable, fitting perfectly into my workflow. Furthermore, by leveraging the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), I was able to create a Linux-like development environment on Windows. This setup allowed me to use Linux commands and tools directly in Windows, offering the best of both worlds for web development.

Choosing Visual Studio Code and WSL over Codeanywhere was a strategic decision to optimize my development process, capitalizing on speed and efficiency without sacrificing the versatility and power needed for complex web development tasks.
